We just received a huge donation from a supporter on Freecycle.
Look at all this cool stuff.  Thank you very much!

![Large Donation](/images/2016-10-10/large-donation.jpg){:width="100%"}

* 2 Epson Stylus Color 580 inkjet printers
* NEC Silentwriter SuperScript 660i laser printer
* HP ScanJet 6200C
* Audiovox in-car DVD player.

Each was absolutely full of useful parts.
Here are the results of the tear-down:

![Scanner and laser printer parts](/images/2016-10-10/scanner-laserprinter.jpg){:width="100%"}

From the inkjets:

* 2 smooth rods
* 2 pairs of matched stepper motors
* 2 belts and idle pulleys
* 2 optical end-stops

From the scanner:

* 1 stepper motor
* 1 belt and idle pulley

From the laser printer:

* 1 small stepper motor
* 1 large stepper motor
* 1 12-volt fan
* 2 optical end-stops

There aren't many moving parts in the DVD player.
With any luck the screen can be used in another application.
