We have our first acquisitions: an Epson Stylus Color 600 and a Dell Photo inkjet printers.

![Epson Stylus Color 6000](/images/2016-10-01/epson-stylus-color-600-parts.jpg){:width="100%"}
 
The Epson had two solid steppers, linear rod, and brass bushings.
One of the steppers also had a matched toothed belt, gear, and a tension pulley.

The Dell had only one stepper connected to the paper feed.
The print head used a standard motor with an optical sensor and did not attach to the linear rod with bushings.
