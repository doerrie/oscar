Oscar the StrapRap

## About

Oscar is a self-bootstrapping RepRap that can be built from salvaged parts.
Because everyone will find different parts, the instructions for assembling Oscar are parameterized.
There are two PDF booklets that can be compiled: the default target Salvage.pdf and a custom Build.pdf.
Salvage.pdf explains the project, what tools you need access to, and how to obtain parts for a new Oscar.
The final instructions in Salvage.pdf describe how to compile printable parts and assembly instructions specific to your parts.
Afterward, Build.pdf will include instructions for building both the bootstrap and replicating Oscar.

## Required Software
