<p>Oscar is a self-bootstrapping RepRap that can be sourced almost entirely from salvage.  The only purchased parts are the controller and the hot-end assembly.  These two products can be purchased online and shipped for less than $50.  </p>

<p>A recent publication suggests that access to a 3D printer can have an incredibly positive financial impact on a home.  Eliminating the need to print parts on parent 3D printer and lowering the cost of assembling a new 3D printer makes this technology more available to everyone.  This is especially important for low-income communities, where access to 3D printers is rare and purchasing kits for hundreds of dollars is not an option.</p>

<a id="what-is-a-straprap" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-straprap" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a StrapRap?</h3>

<p>We use the term StrapRap to describe a self-bootstrapping RepRap.  A RepRap, or Replicating Rapid-Prototyper, is a machine that can reproduce most of its own parts.  The RepRap community defines a RepStrap as a machine, often based on a RepRap design, that can not reproduce its own parts but can be used to bootstrap one that can.  RepStraps are often sold as inexpensive kits for about $300 to $500 or built from whatever materials people happen to have.</p>

<p>To be a self-bootstraping RepRap, a StrapRap must be a RepRap that does not require access to a second RepRap or a RepStrap.  In practice, this means that each part of the machine that can be replicated must have an analog that can be constructed by hand.  The machine is then assembled in two phases: the bootstrap phase and the replacement phase.  In the bootstrap phase, the engineer uses only manually constructed parts to assemble the machine.  In the replacement phase, the engineer incrementally replaces manual parts with freshly minted parts.  Once all of the parts have been replaced, the machine can self-replicate the final version without the need for manual tools.</p>

<p>Americans discard a surprising amount electronic trash every day.  Even when these products no longer function as intended, they often contain many working parts that may be repurposed.  By salvaging parts, an Oscar is a greener printer that is more affordable than its traditional counterparts.</p>

<p>Because Oscar, or any StrapRap, is also a RepRap, the bootstrap phase is not required.  If you are fortunate enough to have access to a 3D printer, you can skip the bootstrap phase entirely.  However, we strongly encourage all builders to progress through the bootstrap phase because this knowledge is invaluable when repairing or upgrading your Oscar.</p>
